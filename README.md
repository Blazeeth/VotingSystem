# Voting System Smart Contract
This is a simple decentralized voting system implemented as an Ethereum smart contract using Solidity. The contract allows a chairperson to initialize proposals, grant voting rights, and manage the voting process. Voters can cast their votes, and the contract determines the winning proposal based on vote count.
